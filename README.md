Finding out maximal product of a set of positive integers whose sum is N.

pre-conditions:
Invalid inputs should return 0, that is non-positive integers or any integer where no set of at least 2 positive addends exists

Logic gose this way:
The maximum product value wil be achieved when we break the give number into multiples of 3's and 2's, whose sum has to match with the given number.

Ex:
For 8 : 
3x2x3 : 18

For 15 : 
3x3x3x3x3 : 243

For 58 : 
3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x2x2 : 1549681956
